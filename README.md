# Skynet Developer Guide

## Welcome!

Welcome to our documentation for developers in the Skynet ecosystem. These build on our [Skynet Guide](https://support.siasky.net) and bring these concepts to life in code and with additional technical details needed by developers. If you need a quick primer on Skynet, reading through the [Getting Started](https://support.siasky.net/getting-started/using-skynet) section will help you understand Skynet before trying to build with it.

## Why Develop on Skynet?

Skynet offers several advantages to developers:

* Developers don't have to manage or pay for any infrastructure.
* Once deployed, applications are independent and need no further caretaking by the developer.
* Application data is user-controlled, available across applications, so your application can utilize pre-existing user information instead of starting from scratch.
* You'll be able to monetize your application without the use of advertising (soon).
