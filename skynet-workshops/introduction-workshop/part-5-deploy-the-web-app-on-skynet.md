# Part 5: Deploy the Web App on Skynet

**Congratulations!** You have a fully functioning Skapp! Let's deploy it and let the world see its wonder! As we mentioned before, deploying an application is as easy as uploading a directory.

1. Build the application with `yarn build`
2. Upload the newly created `build` folder to [https://siasky.net](http://siasky.net). (Make sure you select 'Do you want to upload a web app or directory?')
3. Now any of your friends can make their own certificates!

## Next Steps

Now that you've deployed a Skynet app, there're many things to keep learning!

* You can [learn how to use Handshake](../../developer-guides/setting-up-a-handshake-name.md) for a decentralized human-readable URL like [skyfeed.hns.siasky.net](https://skyfeed.hns.siasky.net).
* You can [automate the deployment](../../developer-guides/deploy-github-actions.md) of your site using a Github Action.
