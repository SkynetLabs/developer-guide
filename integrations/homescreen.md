# Homescreen

## Introduction

Homescreen provides a way for users to save immutable versions of application front-ends. We see this as particularly necessary for the DeFi space for additional security and control over access to decentralized protocols and smart contracts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Homescreen is not yet released but [is available](https://homeapp.hns.siasky.net/) for early-stage testing and integrations. We will be regularly updating this page with the information needed to get your app working with Homescreen, but expect to see further changes.
{% endhint %}

## Integrating with Homescreen

For developers to add support for Homescreen, they need to do a few things:

* Application front-end supports static deployment \(Gatsby & full React Router support coming soon\)
* Assure APIs depend only on decentralized protocols that will remain accessible with front-end updates
* Add an "Add to Homescreen" button on your project's Releases and README that links to Homescreen
