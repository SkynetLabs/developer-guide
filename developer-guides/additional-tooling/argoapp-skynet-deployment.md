## Introduction <a href="introduction" id="introduction"></a>

ArGoApp is an all-in-one deployment platform for modern websites and jamstacks. ArGoApp helps simplify the process of deployment on dCloud. ArGoApp is made for developers who want to deploy their websites on Skynet without writing any code.

If you have a React App and want to deploy it on Skynet directly from your GitHub repository, using ArGoApp, you just need to log in with Github and Select a repo you want to deploy. ArGoApp takes care of all the build steps for the App based on the Framework. All developers need to do is to provide the correct build & deploy configuration in the UI.

ArGoApp Platform not only provides deployment of Dapp on Skynet but there are lots of features required for developers to help them made deployment and hosting simple. Some of the features are:

* CI/CD Pipeline on Github
* Domain (Centralised & Decentralised) Attachment
* Organization & Invite Team
* Archive Project
* Generate Resolver Skylink
* Skynet Homescreen

We are in Beta Testnet so all the payment is done with Test ARGO tokens. Currently, we only charge based on the time taken by your app to get deployed on Skynet. ArGoApp doesnâ€™t charge any provider fees for Skynet deployment at the moment. We will be launching a Subscription and Pay-as-you-go model in the coming days. So, devs would need to take a subscription for Skynet deployment.
