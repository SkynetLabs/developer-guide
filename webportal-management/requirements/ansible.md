## Overview

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) is used to automate much of the portal infrastructure management. The full list of supported actions, playbooks, and initial setup can be found in [ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/SkynetLabs/ansible-playbooks) repo README.

Ansible runs in a docker container, so you will need docker installed on your machine.

The `ansible-playbook` repo is where all the commands live with explanations in the README. The README has setup instructions, **please read them carefully**.&#x20;

The README will point you to a second ansible repo, [ansible-private](https://github.com/SkynetLabs/ansible-private-sample), which you will also need. This `ansible-private` repo also has a README with setup instructions for you to follow.&#x20;
