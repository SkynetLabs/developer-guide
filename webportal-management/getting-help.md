# Getting Help

The best place to get help with webportals is on the [Skynet Labs Discord](https://discord.gg/skynetlabs).

If you are running a webportal, reach out to a member of the Skynet team and have them add the `portal operators` role to your profile. This will then add you to the `#portal-operators` channel where you can post questions and get help from us and other portal operators.
