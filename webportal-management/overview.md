# Overview

The `WEBPORTAL MANAGEMENT` section is geared towards managing a public webportal. With this in mind, the verbiage and recommendations are assuming that the portal operator is running a public webportal comprised of 1 or more load-balanced servers.

Throughout the documentation, the term `portal` will be used to refer to the general Skynet Webportal that is being set up. For example, siasky.net is a portal. The term `server` will be used to refer to the 1 or more load-balanced servers that makes up the Skynet Webportal. Taking the siasky.net portal example, the siasky.net portal is load balanced across serveral servers each running the full portal stack comprised of the skyd daemon, the accounts system, and the webportal layer.&#x20;
