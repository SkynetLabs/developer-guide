# Upgrading

Good news! Upgrading webportals is an easy process. 

During the setup process you were introduced to the [portals-deploy.sh](https://github.com/SkynetLabs/ansible-playbooks#deploy-skynet-webportal) ansible script.  This is the same script that can be used to upgrade webportals to the latest releases.
