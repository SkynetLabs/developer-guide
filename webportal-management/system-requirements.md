# System Requirements

## Hardware

The following are the recommendations for hardware requirements. 

### CPU

Intel Xeon E-2136 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU or better.

### RAM

32GB of ram or more.

### Storage

500GB SSD or more. SSD is required, disk space will be most impacted by the amount of logging the server does. 

## Network

1 Gbps up and down is recommended. 

High limit or unlimited bandwidth is encouraged. Bandwidth usage is of course highly dependant on the usage of each portal but it is important to note, that even with low numbers of new uploads, repair bandwidth will continue to increase over time. 

## System OS

It is recommended that all webportals run Debian 10.

## Applications

### LastPass

Currently, a number of the ansible scripts use LastPass for managing server credentials and common files. If you plan to use the ansible scripts it is currently required to have a LastPass account.
